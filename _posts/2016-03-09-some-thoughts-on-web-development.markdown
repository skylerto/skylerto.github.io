On the bus this morning I was thinking with all these frameworks and languages for web development, what advise would I give my younger self starting a journey into web developing.

# My Developer Journey

Graduating from software engineering in a couple months. No industry experience, hear me out. I'm not clouded by cooperate software, or bring forced to use/sell any frameworks/languages. That being said I have examined each of the following on its own, by itself in personal and freelance software projects.  

  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/) specifically with [expressJS](http://expressjs.com/).  
  * [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)  
  * [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/)  
  * [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).  


# Why listen to me

Simple fact is you don't have to listen to me, I realize I don't have as much experience as some seasoned developers. I don't know every one of these frameworks inside and out - I use them, for the functionality they provide.  

This advise is for my 17 year old self, or any other person seriously looking to dive into web programming.  

# What Are These Good For?

I'll answer this with an analogy. Like coffee, there isn't really any bad frameworks. It's completely subject and depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Not just what you're trying to build think bigger; your business structure, your client, and any constraints placed on you.  

If your business slogan is *"we make web apps in a hurry"* well then something like Rails is best suited for you. If your slogan is *"reliable, scalable, and safe"* you're probably looking at play framework or a Java backend web app.  

Concerning the client, a lot of people are familiar with Wordpress, so if your client is someone posh, who thinks they know all of the things, Wordpress is likely the solution. I don't mean to sound like I have all the answers, however awesome Wordpress is, it gives the client the illusion that they are building their own web app which by having access over dynamic content.  


# Soo...?

If I were to recommend my younger self one language/framework to get really good at, I would recommend Wordpress. Not because of developer productivity, budget, security, or any other reason, other than the sheer fact of how many how many people use it; some clients actually request for a Wordpress site or theme by name.  

With that said, I would also recommend spending a lot of time with javascript, not just client side, but server side as well. I foresee a huge future for javascript, not matter how much I disagree with dynamically typed languages.
