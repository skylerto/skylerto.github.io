## Personal

- The **biggest moment** in 2016, I got engaged to my wonderful, now fiancé.

- I ran a nicely paced _half_ marathon in 2:02.21.

## Education

In 2016, I graduated.

## Music

Spotify didn't send my year in review, because I didn't have my settings
properly configured, so I created a GitHub repo as an example of how I
did this, [2016-music](https://github.com/skylerto/2016-music). Anyways,
here is my top 20 artists of 2016:

1. Keaton Henson
2. mewithoutYou
3. The Head and the Heart
4. In Flames
5. Brand New
6. Bon Iver
7. Wiz Khalifa
8. Yanni
9. Flyleaf
10. Luke Bryan
11. Passenger
12. Saosin
13. Yiruma
14. Modern Life Is War
15. Eluveitie
16. Walk Off the Earth
17. Wintersun
18. La Dispute
19. Vance Joy
20. Priki

## Forward

In 2017, I would like to:  
- Travel/Spend more meaningful time with my family and fiancé.  
- Train and run a full marathon.  
- Spend time decluttering physically and digitally.
