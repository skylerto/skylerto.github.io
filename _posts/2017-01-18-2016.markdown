## Personal

- The **biggest moment** in 2016, I got engaged to my wonderful, now fiancé.

## Education

In 2016, I graduated and got a job in my field 4 days after I walked across the
stage.

## Music

Spotify didn't send my year in review, because I didn't have my settings
properly configured, so I created a GitHub repo as an example of how I
did this, [2016-music](https://github.com/skylerto/2016-music). Anyways,
here is my top 20 artists of 2016:

1. Keaton Henson
2. mewithoutYou
3. The Head and the Heart
4. In Flames
5. Brand New
6. Bon Iver
7. Wiz Khalifa
8. Yanni
9. Flyleaf
10. Luke Bryan
11. Passenger
12. Saosin
13. Yiruma
14. Modern Life Is War
15. Eluveitie
16. Walk Off the Earth
17. Wintersun
18. La Dispute
19. Vance Joy
20. Priki

## [Code](https://github.com/skylerto)

In 2016 I did a lot of side projects as I started to grow myself as a developer
and reach out trying to figure out which technologies I enjoyed working with.  

- Made 1,160 contributions in 2016.  
- I created 35 repositories.  
- This year I my [top 3 languages](http://ghv.artzub.com/#user=skylerto) were Java, JavaScript, and Ruby.  

## Apps

- Goodreads: manage my bookshelf/lack of, digitally.
- workflowy: keep notes on all of the things.
- Fitbit: Track workouts and steps.


## Books

This year my reads were all over the place, I didn't really track how much/what
I read.

- The Art of Asking (audio)
- Core Questions in Philosophy 
- Outlines of Pyrrhonism
- The Google Resume
- Sapiens (audio)
- The 50th Law (audio)
- The Aeneid
- Plate: Five Dialogues

## Forward

In 2017, I would like to:  
- Travel/Spend more meaningful time with my family and fiancé.  
- Train and run a full marathon.  
- Spend time decluttering physically and digitally.  
- Start a [Commonplace
  book](http://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/).
- Track as much of my activities as I can: how I spend my time, which teas/coffees I drink,
  routes/distances I run, apps I try, movies/shows I watch.
